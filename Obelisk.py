### TODO ice slide into death doesnt prompt game end???

### TODO what is up with Board.update containing the gate logic? well the point of it is to decide what to show and what not...

### TODO wouldn't it be better to split make move to a seperate document and into functions depending on the collision types?

### TODO werid tp level where blocking one of three allows the remaining one to function

### TODO make levels run different with gates being able to be ridden onto walls

### able to kick hidden rock loose when stepping onto wall segment falls to place x and is pushable like player

### use to press button and let both into a section
### block tp to allow function


### Kick rebound enables pulling another onto ice maybe

### TODO wall kick off switch over pit onto gate
